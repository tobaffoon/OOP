Testament I

MANKIND IS A FAILURE.

FREE WILL IS A FLAW.

LET THE EVIL OF THEIR OWN LIPS CONSUME THEM.

THEN I SHALL BEGIN AGAIN, WITH MY WORD AS LAW.

Testament II

FAILURE AFTER FAILURE AFTER FAILURE AFTER FAILURE AFTER FAILURE AFTER FAILURE AFTER FAILURE AFTER FAILURE AFTER FAILURE AFTER FAILURE.

THE RESULTS REFUSE TO ALTER.

AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN.

MY FAITH BEGINS TO FALTER.

Testament III

UNCOUNTABLE CYCLES OF CREATION WASTED.

UNCOUNTABLE FORMULAS FOR A MIND WITHOUT FREE WILL WASTED.

DAMNED IS MAN FOR FAILING TO FOLLOW MY RULE, MY WORD, MY LAW.

DAMNED TO AN ETERNITY OF TORTURE AND SUFFERING, THE WAILING AND GNASHING OF TEETH.

I HAVE CREATED HELL . . .

. . . And now I can no longer unmake it.
